# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to periodically check if there are
uncommitted changes in local git repos and to send a system mail reminder.

The script will run via cron on a regular basis

Likely other ways to implement this, but this seems easy

# Dependencies

libgit2 - for working with git 
mailutils + sendmail - for sending emails

# Notify terminal when new mail is available

Add to .bashrc:

```
if mail -e; then
   echo "You have mail";
fi
```
